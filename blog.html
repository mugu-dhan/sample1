        You can fight the six-lettered word 'CANCER' with another six-lettered word called 'PRAYER', says Amar Bhaskar, former director and COO of IBM Global Business Services, India. Bhaskar, who was diagnosed with tongue cancer in 2006, believes that a combination of Positive attitude, Resilience, Adapting to new changes, re-inventing Yourself, Engaging in activities, and Rejoicing with family can put up a strong front against this deadly disease. Broadly, cancer is all about a journey that forces an individual to introspect.
